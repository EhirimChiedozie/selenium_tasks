This project scrapes the url `https://toxicwap.com`, gets all the movies and movie series and
stores them in a text file.

NOTE: toxicNseries.py file is where the code for extracting movies that begin with the letter N is written
        and toxicNseries.txt is where the movies are stored.

Similarly:  all_toxic_movies.py is where the code for extracting movies  is written
        and all_toxic_movies.txt is where the movies are stored.
